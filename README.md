Providing a CSS Website Facelift
CSC 260 Project 1 

The Heart of Kentucky Kids organization aims to ensure the best early care and education so that every child in Boyle and Mercer counties is ready for kindergarten.  We support collaborative community partnerships to implement evidence-based strategies that address local early childhood needs.

Their website https://www.hkykids.org/ serves as a hub of local information, services, and resources for caregivers of pre-kindergarten students.  

While the information on this site is quite excellent, it is in need of a facelift.  You will be provided a set of "clean" HTML files that contains the website's information, but has been stripped of all CSS.  Your ultimate goal is to provide a CSS file that will be the new "face" of Heart of Kentucky Kids.
Phase 1: Getting to know the HTML

In phase 1, you will create a CSS file to recreate the present Heart of Ky Kids website.  While there are some differences between your clean HTML and the website, you should replicate the look and feel of the original website as much as possible.

Notes:
Start by creating a CSS file with all of the type and class selectors that you find in the html files.  This will give you a template of "hooks" you can latch into to build your solution.
If you are using Chrome, a left click will allow you to inspect any element for information on the existing css values.
The navigation menu is "flat" and will not need a drop down. 
While there are underlying similarities across many pages, there are some differences in size and layout of the information.  You should capture this in your CSS.  Note that there is a unique id for each body tag.
The header photo is located in the imgs folder.  You can use CSS to apply a background image.
The inspect tools should not indicate any errors from your CSS.

Phase 2: Providing a new face

Our Heart of KY Kids contact Hannah Beth provided these thoughts as you work to create a new face for the organization's website.

Easy to read for parents of young children, possibly with a low adult reading level. Mostly using a phone to access the internet.
Happy, bright families and encouraging messaging. Images should not be sad, grey, and showing "Children in need", but showing connected, engaged, growing kids & families instead!
Bigger, more exciting donation section
You are of course encouraged to make other priorities as you see fit, but you will be asked to explain why they should be priorities for this project.

Notes:

There is a chapter on Mobile Web devices, you are welcome to reference on differences in designing for mobile vs desktop viewing experiences.
You can simulate a mobile phone in chrome by using the "Toggle Device Tool Bar" inside the inspect tools.  (CTRL-SHIFT-M)
You are encouraged to add pictures for your project.  These should be free of copyright either due to their release, or because they are pictures you have taken/produced on your own.
There are CSS solutions to adding pictures, fonts, and even text that does not change the HTML.  You should feel encouraged to add new content through these means.
Should your design require it, you can "hide" elements using css.  Sometimes less is more!
When doing real design, many of the things you design and implement will blend into the background.  I.e. they don't draw attention to themselves, but their absence does make the work suffer.  Be sure to document these things and discuss them in your deliverables.



Deliverables

Files: You will submit the git repository that contains all of your CSS for Phase1 and Phase 2 as well as all images that you have added.  Your repository should be public or if you do make it private add me as a collaborator (michaelkbradshaw).

Presentation: You will present your phase 2 offering on Wednesday morning (Jan 14th), when we will have our collaborator join us.  Your presentation should highlight how your design works, as well as overarching themes and other design choices.  In particular focus on how it meets the design goals provided by Hannah Beth.  Your presentation should not be longer than 4 minutes.  May include slides, live demos, or can even be prerecorded and posted on Youtube.

Documentation: You will provide a 1 page maximum document to explain the features and design decisions of your website.  This will need to be submitted online and a paper hard copy submitted in class.  You are welcome to make it a bulleted list, however, it must describe what you did and why it added something to the final product.  These are typically things that are hard to see if you don't know about it.  Help me see it!
